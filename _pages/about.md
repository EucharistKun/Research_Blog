I am a current graduate student in the Narasimhan Lab at the University of Texas at Austin looking to expand my knowledge of biology, genetics, and computer science in order to improve cancer research. I joined this lab in March of 2021 after hearing of a project that Vagheesh wanted to undertake. To directly pull from Vagheesh's website, "we are building machine learning methods, particularly deep learning approaches to automatically extract features and phenotypes from a variety of biomedical imaging datasets and then connecting these with genomic information to understand the genetic basis of these traits." It sounded like a daunting task as a biochemistry graduate student with a limited background in computer science, but I was intrigued and felt like this was an area of up and coming interest that could have potentially powerful applications for medical and in particular, cancer research.

I wasn't always sure what I would end up doing when I grew up
