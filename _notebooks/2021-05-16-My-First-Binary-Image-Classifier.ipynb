    "The crux of my first project in this lab involved taking patients from the UK Biobank who had been diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis (OA) and attempting to train a classifier using machine learning (ML) on X-rays of these patients' hips. Hip OA is typically diagnosed by looking at X-rays of the hip, specifically looking at the hip-joint space between the hip and the pelvis as well as other diagnostic markers more clearly described [here](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/osteoarthritis-of-the-hip?lang=us). In the image below, the hip on the left side of the picture has OA while the right hip is normal."

    "An added layer of depth to this project involved seeing if we could look at other X-rays or images from other body parts of these patients not typically used in diagnosing hip OA and whether or not these additional images could give some additional diagnostic clues or outcome predictors for hip OA. So if, for example, looking at only a hip X-ray for diagnosing hip OA had generally 85% accuracy, could looking at an X-ray of the spine improve diagnostic accuracy or tell us something about potential health outcomes for the patient. Though it seems unlikely for this particular disease, this line of thinking could be broadly applied to a variety of diseases. Say liver cancer is typically diagnosed through a liver MRI, but what if taking a brain CT scan alongside a liver MRI gave earlier diagnostic accuracy or could predict disease severity? Thinking along these lines, I set out to create and attempt to understand my first classifier - whether or not my model could predict if a patient had hip OA or not based upon just a hip X-ray."

I placed these patient folders containing the X-ray images into two separate folders, one labeled OA_200 and another labeled Not_OA_200.

    "\n",
    "Clearly, the classifier did not have a very high accuracy in determining hip OA based on hip X-rays. However, any trained doctor is generally able to diagnose hip OA based upon X-rays alone. One extremely noteable source of errors lies in the fact that the metadata obtained for each patient did not specify which hip had OA. OA typically only presents itself in a single hip for each patient, and without that information, some of these hip X-rays were misleading as they could be fully healthy and not the correct hip. Furthermore, it is possible that this image classification is not as overt as we originally thought. However, that does not explain the extremely low accuracy that my classifier generated after training. "

Without any meaningful OA diagnosis information, each classifier had about the same accuracy as this classifier, around 50%, no better than a coin flip. It was at this point that we decided to abandon the project for now, but the idea here could be broadly applied to different diseases and medical images."
